<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
Developing an AI-based personalised health monitoring system that can adapt to individual health conditions and provide personalised health recommendations.

<h2>Description:</h2> 
With the rise of digital health, wearable devices, and health apps, people are increasingly interested in monitoring their health and wellness. However, not all health conditions are the same, and people's health needs and goals can differ widely. To provide effective health monitoring and recommendations, an AI-based system needs to be adaptive, able to understand individual health conditions and adjust its recommendations accordingly.

<h2>Solution:</h2>
We will develop an AI-based personalised health monitoring system that can adapt to individual health conditions and provide personalised health recommendations. The system will be able to converse with users. It will use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in chat, and provide personalised health recommendations to the user. The goal is to provide an efficient and effective health monitoring system that can help individuals improve their health and wellness.
